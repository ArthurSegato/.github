## Pull Requests

Pull requests offer an excellent avenue for incorporating your ideas into this repository.

When determining whether to merge a pull request, I consider the following criteria:

### Does it state intent

You should clearly articulate the problem you're addressing with your contribution.

For example:

> Add a link to the code of conduct in README.md

does not provide insight into the rationale behind the change. Conversely,

> Add a link to the code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

not only identifies the problem but also presents the solution.

### Is it of good quality

- Ensure there are no spelling mistakes.
- Ensure readability and coherence.
- For English language contributions: Aim for a high score on [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/).

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

- Description of objective 1.
- Description of objective 2.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and contributions that violate it will be addressed accordingly.
